        **About these parameters:**
        - **Coaches per cohort** reflects our current cohort size
        - **We train one cohort per month**
        - **We think we could handle cohorts of 20 without much issue**
        - **Clients per coach** and **sessions per client** are our current averages
        - While our retention would imply a lower average number of sessions, many clients choose to extend and the coach agrees
        
        **These estimates are conservative because they assume no improvement despite:**
        - **Hiring manager will attract larger applicant pools**, allowing us to be more selective and hire higher-quality coaches
        - **Our hiring process is still being refined** - better selection criteria should reduce training costs and improve coach effectiveness  
        - **Current performance metrics reflect periods of client shortage** - coaches working below capacity may underperform compared to when fully utilized
        - **We're using above-market salaries in our calculations** (except branch manager) - we could potentially hire at lower market rates
        - **No automation improvements assumed** - we see clear opportunities to automate scheduling, admin tasks, and initial assessments
